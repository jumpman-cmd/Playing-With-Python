# Arithmetic Operations in Python

## Problem Statement
The task is to write a Python program that reads two integers from standard input, performs three arithmetic operations (sum, difference, and product), and prints the results of these operations.

### Detailed Requirements:
1. **Input**: 
    - The program should read two integers from the user.
2. **Operations**:
    - Compute the sum of the two integers.
    - Compute the difference between the first and the second integer.
    - Compute the product of the two integers.
3. **Output**:
    - Print the results of the sum, difference, and product operations, each on a new line.

## Solution Explanation
To achieve the desired outcome, the program follows these steps:

1. **Reading Input**: 
    - Use the `input()` function to read two lines of input, each containing an integer.
    - Convert these inputs from strings to integers using the `int()` function.

2. **Performing Arithmetic Operations**:
    - **Sum**: Calculate the sum of the two integers using the `+` operator.
    - **Difference**: Calculate the difference between the first and the second integer using the `-` operator.
    - **Product**: Calculate the product of the two integers using the `*` operator.

3. **Printing Results**:
    - Use the `print()` function to output the results of the sum, difference, and product operations, each on a separate line.

### Example
If the input values are `3` and `2`, the program should output:
5
1
6

This ensures that the operations are performed correctly based on the input values and the results are printed in the required format. The solution will pass all test cases on platforms like HackerRank.

## Getting Started
To run the program, follow these steps:
